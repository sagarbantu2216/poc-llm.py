Hospital Course
Pt is a 75-year-old female who presented to Lodi Memorial Hospital on 15
January 2023 for sepsis secondary due to aspiration pneumonia and was found
to have a dilated esophagus subsequently had EGD done which
confirmed esophageal obstruction due to prior gastric lap banding.  Patient was
started on IV Zosyn and TPN, patient was transferred for laparoscopic removal
of lap band port.  Patient was evaluated by DR Huber and underwent
laparoscopic removal of lap band.  She was started on clear liquid diet and diet
was advanced to regular diet.  General surgery cleared her for discharge back
to Lodi Memorial Hospital for disposition.
Patient has clinically improved since lap band removal. She has competed abx
course of zosyn and PT recommended discharge to SNF. ST recommended
Regular textured diet with thin liquids. She is a nares MRSA carrier.

Reason For Exam:  Pneumonia - confirmed
REPORT:   ******** ADDENDUM #1 ********The
ordering physician did call and we discussed the
case. The free intraperitoneal air is compatible with
the recent surgery.

Signed by: Frank Hartwick, MD on 1/26/2023 7:46
PM******** ORIGINAL REPORT ********History:
This examination is requested for "reeval for
clearance". Chest radiograph January 17, 2023
demonstrated right upper lobe infiltrate. No
subsequent study at this facility. Patient did have a
surgical procedure at another facility in the interval
but date of the surgery is not included in the
patient's medical record.There is free air under the
right hemidiaphragm of relatively small volume. The
surgery was recent the free air is not felt to be
suspicious. Correlate with date of surgery and clinical
presentation.There is continued patchy and nodular
infiltrate in the mid upper right lung. Thick linear
band of density is present at the medial right
base.Left lung is clear and moderately expanded.
Heart size is normal. Aorta is tortuous.

Impression:
Nodular infiltrate in the right upper
lung is still present but improving. Underlying tumor
is not excluded but pneumonia is most likely.
Recommend continued follow-up.Free intraperitoneal
air. See discussion above.Message was sent to the
ordering physician via secured text requesting phone
consultation but the ordering physician is unable to
call at this time and will review the report.

Computerized Tomography
Result Type:  CT Angio Chest W Con
Result Date:  January 15, 2023  19:29 PST
Reason For Exam:  Pulmonary Embolism
REPORT:   History:  Shortness of breath.Technique:
Following the rapid intravenous administration of
nonionic contrast, tracker timed CT angiography of
the central pulmonary vessels was performed with
axial, coronal and sagittal as well as MPR and 3D reconstructions. Dose reduction techniques were
utilized including automated exposure control (AEC),
iterative reconstruction technique, and/or mA and/or
kV dose adjustments based on patient size. CTDI:
21.13 mGy. DLP:  348.40 mGy-cm.Known prior
CTs/myocardial perfusion studies last 12 months: 0

Findings:    Pulmonary arteries enhance normally
without filling defect to suggest pulmonary
embolism.  Main pulmonary artery caliber is normal.fluticasone nasal (Flonase 50mcg/inh nasal spray) 2 Sprays Nose
TWICE DAILY. Refills: 3.
meclizine (meclizine 25 mg oral tablet)
1 Tabs Oral THREE TIMES A
DAY as needed for dizziness. Refills: 1.
multivitamin (Multivitamins oral tablet) 1 Tabs Oral DAILY.
omeprazole (omeprazole 20 mg oral delayed release capsule) 1
Capsules Oral AT BEDTIME. Refills: 2.
Time Spent Coordinating Discharge
40 mins
Aortic caliber and luminal enhancement are normal.
Massively dilated debris laden esophagus is seen
throughout. There is a lap band in place.Tiny right
pleural effusion is present. Patchy right lower and
more dense right upper lobe consolidation is
consistent with pneumonia and probably related to
aspiration. Left lung is clear. Heart size is
normal.Multiple lower thoracic kyphoplasties are
present.
Impression:    No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Suspect extensive right lung aspiration pneumonia
related to the dilated debris filled esophagus.Lap
band in place may be obstructing.DICTATION NOTE:
